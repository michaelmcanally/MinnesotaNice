In particular, geolocation data will be critical from the Foursquare API.\n\n### A more detailed description of data requirements follows:\n\n* Neighborhood names will be pulled from the mncompass website:\n * https://www.mncompass.org/profiles/neighborhoods/minneapolis-saint-paul#!community-areas \n* Neighborhood names will be associated with zip codes using the the methods described in the StackOverflow post:\n * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6347275/does-anyone-know-of-a-free-neighborhood-database\n   * Briefly, this uses two lists. A full list of the zip codes of the US then a cross ref to the USGS Domestic Names database that is associated with neighborhoods.\n   * https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/board-on-geographic-names/domestic-names\n* Neighborhood borders based on zip code will be obtained using the 'uszipcode' package from PyPI:\n * https://pypi.org/project/uszipcode/#description\n   * Additional data from 'uszipcode' will be pulled including census demographics, real estate and housing, employment data, and educational attainment.\n   \n* Foursquare data will be obtained similar to the Toronto neighborhood analysis. We plan to look at restaurants, parks, schools, and spiritual centers.\n * https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/resources/categories \n \n* Walk scores for the neighborhoods will be obtained from the 'Walk Score' API:\n * https://www.walkscore.com/professional/api.php  \n \n* Finally, crime data will be imported from the SpotCrime API:\n * https://github.com/contra/spotcrime  ",
